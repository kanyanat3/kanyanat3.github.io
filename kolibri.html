			<h4> The Challenge </h4>
			<p> Kolibri offers a collection of teaching materials that teachers can use to supplement their classes and students can use to learn at their own pace. The contents are in forms of podcasts, videos, online textbooks, and review quizzes. Learning may be difficult for students, so we want to give students the tools they need to learn at their best. More importantly, we want to design responsive pages so students from around the world can learn from computers, tablets, and mobile phones, whichever they have access to.
			</p>

			<br>

			<h4> Goals </h4>
			<p> This project's success would entail extensive research of media displays and adaptability to varying devices (desktop, tablet, mobile). The endgoal is to design an interface with necessary tools for each content type. Overall, the interface should support and promote the learners' educational experience. </p>

			<br>

			<h4> Contributions </h4>
			<p> User Task Analysis | Competitive Analysis | Wire-framing | High-fidelity prototyping<br> Marisa and I collaborated on extensive competitive analysis of media interfaces across educational and other related platforms. Out of 4 types of media involved (audio, video, text, quiz), my focus was on video and quiz interfaces. The wireframes and prototypes shown here are my personal contributions. </a> </p>

			<br>

			<h4> Deliverables </h4>
			<p> Competitive analysis, high-fidelity prototype, interactive prototype of each media type </p>

			<h4> User Research </h4>
			<p> Prior to the start of this project, the UX Design team had visited a school in a rural area in India to test early prototypes of Kolibri. Working with volunteer students, the team interviewed them, asking questions such as "What technology devices do you have at home?", "How often did you use them in the past week?", and "Have you used an education application before?" In addition, the team presented the prototype, gave tasks to perform, and observed their interactions and any difficulties they experienced. I used the results of this user research project to create personas and contextualize my own design process. </p>
			
			<br>
			<p style="font-size: 22px"> Personas </p>
			<p>
			These personas were created based on the interviews that were conducted by the team. They are used to represent different types of learners/students that will be using Kolibri. Each vary in terms of familiarity with technology or experience with learning and education. 
			</p><p>
			<b> Hannah, Technology Expert </b> Hannah is a 15 year-old who owns a smart phone and is a daily user. She is very familiar with the common interface such as the hamburger button, the tap and hold, and the swipe to delete. For the most part, she is doing well in school, but she is struggling with chemistry and wants a little extra help. 
			<br>
			</p>
			<p>
			<b> Jason, Technology Novice </b> Jason is a 12 year-old who doesn't own a phone or a computer at home. He uses the school computers to perform a search or finish his homework. Sometimes he isn't sure what an icon means or how he can recover something he accidentally deleted. When on a website or application, he wants to be able to quickly learn how to use it. 
			</p>
			<p>
			<b> Tera, Struggling Learner </b> Tera is a 16 year-old who needs a bit more time to understand the materials being taught. Sometimes she has to hear the explanation or read the textbook a couple of times before she fully understands it. When distracted, it takes her some time to focus back on her lessons. She wants to learn at her own pace and maintain a focus while studying.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b> Luke, English Learner </b> Luke is a 9 year-old whose first language is Spanish. He has been learning English for a while, but finds it difficult to hear when others speak too fast. It is even more challenging when the speaker has an accent he is not familiar with. When learning, he wants to be able to understand the speaker easily.
			</p>
				<br>
			<h4> Design Guidelines </h4>
			<p> From the user research and the project brief, I created design guidelines to frame the design process. These were reference points used to measure the progress and effectiveness of the design. </p> 
			<p>
				<b> Universal Design </b> Create an interface that is clear and intuitive across different levels of technology experience. 
				<br>
				<b> Immersive Experience </b> Maintain students' focus in learning, free from disruptions, by incorporating a line-up of learning content and simple transitions between them.	
				<br>
				<b> Enhance Learning Interaction </b> Help students learn and review materials by providing needed learning tools (subtitles, transcriptions, speed control, etc.) but maintaining an easily understandable interface. 
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="infoMargin competitiveA">
			<h4> UI Competitive Analysis </h4>
			<p> Apart from the high-level guidelines, I also performed research on the interface design, focusing on responsive websites. Since the design will adapt to different screen sizes, it was crucial that I use screen space very efficiently and still maintain consistency across  devices. I analyzed different websites on how information can get condensed on a smaller screen, but still remain accessible. In terms of the learning tools, I researched other platforms to find out what functionalities they offer to facilitate a positive learning experience. I then compiled examples of platforms that are thoughtfully designed. Below is a subset of that analysis, highlighting intuitive layouts and useful functionalities.

					<p > <b> Responsive Nav Bar. </b> At smaller screen sizes, the functionalities are integrated in the hamburger menu. Horizontal arrangements convert to vertical layouts. Collapsible fields can be used to shorten the content length. </p>
					<p> <b> Video Controls. </b> For simple videos, 5 basic controls at the bottom is usually sufficient. For educational content, additional functionalities (i.e. transcriptions) are helpful to learning. </p>
					<p> <b> Video-Related Content. </b> The space immediately below the video is crucial, possibly displaying video descriptions, links to other video, or the transcriptions. Allowing users to toggle between subpages maximizes space usage. </p>
					
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-6" style="padding-right:0; margin-top:1.6%">
					<p> <b> Quiz Feedback. </b> An anchored bar keeps the button to check answers and view progress available at all times. For learners, receiving immediate feedback about their answer choice helps solidify their understanding of the content. When the answer is incorrect, giving the link to view the original video provides quick access to review content.</p>
					<p > <b> Quiz Review. </b> After quiz completion, learners should be able to revisit the questions, answer choices, selected answer, and explanation for the correct answer. From the overall review, learners can find patterns in their answer choices and  determine specific contents to review.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<br>
			<div>
				<p> Through this analysis, I collected samples of current practices for a responsive interface as well as useful learning tools and their on-screen layout. I learned some techniques for using space efficiently such as toggling different content, allowing  users to determine what information is most useful to them. This, and other useful design strategies, will be considered and potentially adapted for the Kolibri interface design.

		<div class="infoMargin">
			<h4> Wireframes </h4> 
			<p> Based on the previous design guidelines and the competitive analysis, I sketched out multiple versions of the video and quiz layouts in both mobile and desktop sizes. Each version of the wireframe was a hypothesis. Would learners value the course information or the transcription more? Should the interface show quiz responses for the last 5 or 10 questions? I created different wireframe variations so I could later assess the benefits of one versus another, or potentially combine parts of multiple wireframes. </p>

			<h4> Discussion with ux design team </h4> 
			<p> Marissa and I walked through our wireframes for Learning Equality's UX Design Team and received useful feedback for future improvements. </p>
<!-- 			<p> <b> Full screen video experience. </b>
			One goal as an education technology is to enable an immersive learning experience for learners. We needed to find ways to transition seamlessly between different contents in order to keep the focus centered on learning. </p>  -->
<!-- 			<p> <b>Unified video and audio player interface.</b> 
			To keep the Kolibri software light-weight, we will use the same interface for video and audio player. The player interface needs to reflect necessary functionalities for both while highlighting the functionalities appropriate to each content type.  -->

			<p> 
			<b> Transcription </b>
			In the video interface, displaying a transcription is useful since it allows students to read through the speaking portions of the lesson. The English Learners may find this helpful when they have a hard time hearing the sentences or when learning to spell certain words. One improvement may be to include a transcript search as well. This can allow the Struggling Learners to search a certain key term and easilly review that section of the video.
			</p>

			<p>
			<b>Quiz point system. </b>
			In the quiz interface, learners must answer "X" questions correctly out of the next "Y" in order to pass. The exact numbers vary between different quizzes. We should consider different visual metaphors that can be used to indicate how many questions were answered correctly and how many more are needed.
			</p>

			<p>
			<b>Quiz review. </b>
			The reviews shown after the quiz are useful for seeing the correct and incorrect answers for each question. Struggling Learners can click on the videos linking to the original content of that quiz question. This  would help Struggling Learners review and have another exposure to the content.
			</p>

			<p>
			<b>App bar. </b> 
			The overall Kolibri design will be following <a href="https://material.io/guidelines/material-design/introduction.html"> Google's Material Design Guidelines </a>. Specifically, the team has decided on utilizing the app bar, which is used for branding, navigation, search, and other actions. We were asked to incorporate this app bar to our wireframes. This should help maintain a clean and consistent interface across pages, which would help the Technology Novice learn to use the interface more quickly. </p>

			<p> Due to the time and cost constraints, I wasn't able to perform user testing with these initial wireframes. The UX team travels about once per year to conduct user research and testing in the context of the target users, which is often rural regions of third world countries such as India and Guatemala. Unfortunately, the testing timeline did not coincide with the period of this project. Instead, the UX team will include this prototype in the next testing session. </p>

			<h4> Final Thoughts </h4> 
			<p> Learning about responsive media was one of the most challenging and rewarding aspects of this project. When there is such an wide array of devices and screen sizes, it was valuable to learn how to convey information and provide a positive experience through different interface dimensions. I believe I've accomplished, to a certain degree, the goal of designing a interface that is intuitive and clutter-free, while still giving students the tools they need to succeed in learning. Due to the time constraint of the project, some aspects of the design were not fully developed. If given more time, I would work on designing a video playlist feature that has sequenced videos in order to offer a more focused learning experience.
			</p>
			<p>
			While working on this project, I found Kolibri's mission of expanding education resources to areas that lack access to internet to be very motivating. It has potential to empower students to develop skills that can lead to brighter futures. I am proud and honored to have worked on this project and I hope it can make a difference in improving access to education.
