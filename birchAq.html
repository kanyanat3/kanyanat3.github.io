				Affiliated with UC San Diego, the <a href="https://aquarium.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank"> Birch Aquarium </a> houses marine lives and offers various exhibits for visitors to enjoy. The exhibits are educational and interactive, designed to communicate the pressing environmental challenges of today. ​Current plans to remodel the exhibit focuses on the theme of exploration in science, as related to journeys taken by oceanographers to assess conditions of the natural environment. Diving frigid waters, exploring Antartica icebergs, and living in the middle of the Pacific Ocean are some of the adventurous and rewarding experiences that oceanographers encounter. </p>

			<h4> The Challenge </h4>
			<p> The Birch Aquarium hopes to portray scientists and oceanographers as explorers with the passion to better understand natural occurrences and preserve the Earth. They make week or even month-long trips to measure chemicals in the ocean water or study the coral changes. However, many portrayals of scientists through the media are often superficial and incomplete. Through stories, personal motivations, and challenges, this exhibit should aim to humanize scientists and challenge current stereotypes. 
			 </p>

			<br>

			<h4> Goals </h4>
			<p> A well-designed exhibit should be engaging, family-friendly, and informative. After interacting with this exhibit, visitors should feel that they are able to relate to the scientists and understand the passion and motivation behind their work. Ultimately, we want the visitors to realize the importance of the work and be inspired to take part in protecting the Earth.  </p>

			<br>

			<h4> Contributions </h4>
			<p> User Research | Ideation | Competitive Analysis | User Testing <br> I made significant contributions to all aspects of the project including interviewing, brainstorming design ideas, prototyping, and user testing at the aquarium. The final high-fidelity prototype shown here is my personal contribution.  </p>

			<br>

			<h4> Deliverables </h4>

			<h4> On-site observation and interview </h4>
			<p> Our team visited the Birch Aquarium to observe visitors' experience in the aquarium space. I wanted to find out which exhibits received a lot of attention and what aspects made them appealing. 
			</p>
			<p><b> Visual attraction </b> Visitors loved the big floor-to-ceiling glass tank. Their eyes filled with wonder as they watched the school of fish zooming across the tank or the long, narrow seaweed flowing in the water. Kids pressed their noses and hands against the glass to get a look at the sea turtle swimming by. A 9 year-old told me: <i>"Seeing the big fish was my favorite part!"</i>
			</p>
			<p><b> Physical interaction </b> Kids gravitated towards any exhibit that had a button, lever, wheel, and so on. They were eager to interact with the exhibit and find out how it will respond. To them, it seems that the sense of surprise and novelty throughout the interaction made it a fun experience.
			<br>
			<br>
			 I also conduct interviews with 4 staff members (gift shop store manager, visitor service manager, guest greeter, and ticket collector) to learn about what experiences the visitors were walking away with. Since the staff members were very familiar with the aquarium, my goal was to find out what issues they can identify as needing improvement. I discovered a few points of interest: 
			</p>
			<p> <b> 1. Aquarium's message not clearly expressed </b> May, the member greeter at the information desk, told me <i> "Visitors were often more focused on the visual presentation rather than the overall message." </i> She said that the aquarium is associated with the research institute and its goal is to promote engagement for environmental causes. In her point of view however, it's unclear whether visitors take that message to heart after leaving the aquarium. 
			</p>
			<p> <b> 2. Parents tend to not interact with the exhibits </b> May commented about parents' lack of interaction: <i> "Parents shy away from interacting with the exhibits. They think that the exhibits are geared towards children and they don't want to receive judgment for taking a child's spot." </i> When adults are staying back and letting their kids play and explore, the aquarium loses an opportunity to communicate its message to a large portion of their visitors. 
			</p>
			<p> <b> 3. Outdated exhibit content </b> A portion of the visitors are members or locals who frequently visit the aquarium. Nancy, the ticket collector, said that <i> "members would like to see fresh content." </i> Creating an exhibit that can be periodically updated can make the visitors eager to come back. 
			</p>
			<p>
			<br>
			I uncovered many good insights from the observation and interviews. Overall, I wanted to design an exhibit that is open to people of all ages and inspires visitors with messages about the natural environment. These insights will frame the design process and later guide the prototype ideation. 
			</p>
				<br>
			<h4> Surveys </h4>
			<p> Going back to the exhibit goals of breaking the stereotypes of scientists, I wanted understand how people currently view scientists. I created a survey asking participants this question: <br> "What comes to mind when you imagine a scientist?"</p> 
			<p> <b>Survey details:</b> 58 participants &nbsp | &nbsp  ages: 14-22  &nbsp |  &nbsp 57.4% Female &nbsp 37.7% Male &nbsp 4.9% Other </p> <br>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-6">

					<p> <b> 6.9% of participants </b> mentioned qualities such as the passion for making a difference as well as the interest in the living things and the environment. These qualities show scientists as intrinsically motivated and enthusiastic about their work. </p>

			<h4> INTERVIEWS </h4>
			<p> How do people currently think of scientists? Posing the same question, we received similar trends of responses in our interviews. However, we were able to converse with the participant and dig deeper into possible influences of their perspectives. <br></p>

					<p> <b> Insight</b> The media may offer a one dimensional story of scientists and the typical associations of labs, lab coats, and microscopes. However, genuine interactions with scientists or associated people can offer new perspectives. These experiences can humanize scientists and reveal a more complete story of their passion and motivations.</p>

			<h4> DEFINING THE DESIGN CHALLENGE </h4> 
			<p> I framed the design challenge in order to guide our prototyping approaches. From user research, I concluded our findings and put together a design approach that addresses the challenge. </p>
			<p> <b> Current state: </b> First thoughts about scientists are often stereotypical environments, tools, and associations. On the other hand, characteristics such as curiosity, determination, and passion are rarely mentioned. </p>
			<p> <b> How stereotypes arise: </b> It's easy to convey the concept of a scientist by presenting visual aspects (labs, lab coats, goggles) that immediately communicate the idea. It's more difficult to show more complex characteristics such as curiosity and passion. </p>
			<p> <b> Design Challenge: </b> How can we design an aquarium exhibit that challenges the stereotypes and changes the way people think about scientists? </p>
			<p> <b> Approach to Design challenge: </b> The stereotypical images may or may not be accurate but regardless, it is  a one-sided story. We can challenge the stereotype by introducing other stories about challenges, motivations, and aspirations that humanize scientists and make them more relatable. </p>
		</div>

		<div class="infoMargin discussion" style="margin-bottom:2%">
			<h4> PROTOTYPING as A HYPOTHESIS </h4> 
			<p> We can humanize scientists by allowing aquarium visitors to have a personal conversation with the scientists. However, it would be neither practical nor impactful on a large scale to ask scientists and oceanographers to converse with visitors individually. Instead, what if we could simulate the conversation? </p>
			<p> <b> Design concept: </b> Instead of inviting scientists to the aquarium, we can conduct an interview with a scientist and ask them to discuss their work, motivations, impact, and challenges. This gives them an opportunity to reveal aspects of being a scientist that is often overlooked. With permission, we will videotape the interview and use it as part of the aquarium exhibit.  </p> 
			<p> <b>Design Goal: </b> Spark a connection and interest by hearing the first-hand experiences of a scientist. The stories that differ from the stereotypical images can expand the views of scientists, adding on to the variety of topics, tools, and environments they work in. Furthermore, hearing the struggles as well as success brings out the imperfection that’s often not shown, but shows a more authentic perspective of the profession. </p>

			<h4> Prototype Testing </h4> 
			<p> Do aquarium visitors see scientists in a new light and have a more well-rounded perspective of them? I went to the Birch Aquarium and asked interested visitors to test out the prototype. My goal was to get feedback on whether the exhibit prototype effectively addresses the design challenge. I received a wide range of responses from different user types.  </p>
			<p> <b> Children: </b> Children were not fully engaged with the interview-style videos. They were quite distractible and had difficulty paying attention to a lengthy video, which displayed the scientist conversing with the interviewer. </p> 
			<p> <b> Teenagers: </b> Teenagers were intrigued by the stories told. They listened attentively and were eager to ask more questions. In the follow up interview, they told us that they learned novel and unexpected things about scientists. </p>
			<p> <b> Parents of kids: </b> Since the kids were easily distractible, the adults were attending to their kids and had difficulty focusing on the prototype as well.  </p> 
			<p> <b> Resulting insight: </b> Teenagers appreciated the stories told in a first-person narrative form because it gave fresh perspectives to the scientific works. They paid close attention and had meaningful takeaways from the video. However, younger children were more difficult to engage and may require other means of capturing their attention. </p>
		</div>

		<div class="infoMargin birchFinalPT">
			<h4> Final prototype </h4>
			<p>Can we use more engaging visuals to help direct the attention of young children? We iterated on the prototype by modifying the videos themselves. To engage younger audiences at the aquarium, we created an animation video that visually illustrates the stories being told. Drawings are sketched out and words are emphasized in correspondence with the pace of the story. </p>

			<p style="font-size: 13px; text-align: center"> Credits to Emiliy Tao for the awesome video sketch! </p>
			<br>
			<p> In the final prototype, I incorporated the video sketch which offers a multimodal style of communication, engaging the audience through the story as well as the visuals. At the end of each video, users can select a question from the available choices to ask the scientist. Tapping on the question will lead to another video where the scientist will address the question, simulating a back-and-forth style of conversations. </p>

				<h4> Final Thoughts </h4> 
				<p> The highlight of this project was the testing of the exhibit prototype in the real aquarium setting. With the help of aquarium goers who volunteered to try the prototype, I was able to see reactions and interactions in the real context. Some interactions were anticipated while other reactions were insightful and informative of how the prototype can be modified to improve the experience. With just one visit to the aquarium, the exhibit design was improved and much more human-centered. 
				</p>
				<p>
				By bringing out stories told authentically and enthusiastically by oceanographers, this exhibit design can help aquarium goers understand oceanographers on a more personal basis. This essentially builds a sense of empathy and humanizes the oceanographers as scientists who are eager to explore the depths of the ocean as they seek to protect the nature. I am excited and proud to see this project come to completion, as it helps bring to light the aspects of passion, drive, and sacrifice that are often missing from portrayals of science.
